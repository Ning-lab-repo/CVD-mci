CVD-mci

We developed a ML framework based on the NHANES database that enables mediation causal inference and the identification of CVD mortality subgroups in the general population. This framework requires only 10 common clinical variables to predict CVD mortality risk over the next 10 years, stratify mortality risk, and uncover potential mechanisms underlying transitions between different CVD mortality subgroups. These mediation causal relationships can be validated using the UKB regional dataset. 

Requirements

The main requirements are listed below:

Python 3.11

R 4.4
